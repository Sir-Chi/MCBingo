##Some calculations may look like they are being reversed but due to the stack overflow (as it uses integers) in Minecraft which cycles numbers over a certain (quite large) number
#it adds to the randomisation to do this. Sometimes it does reverse the last few calcualtions (making them redundant) but sometimes it creates new numbers due to the overflow.
#Thus adding to the randsomisation. mod in the S scoreboard is Modulus, used to divide target's score by source's score, and use the remainder to set the target score, to get
# an exact figure within a set range.
