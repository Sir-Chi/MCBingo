# Bingo

Bingo is a vanilla Minecraft survival scavenger hunt game mode, in which players need to explore, slay, mine and craft in order to fill out a Bingo Card.

## How To Install

To play the game create a new minecraft world and add this datapack into the world's datapack folder. Make sure the world has "Allow Cheats" enabled. Once you load into the world run the command "/function bingo:master/setup" directly or run the command "/reload" to have the command appear in chat for you to click. This will create the Bingo Lobby.

If on a server, make sure that command blocks are turned on in the server configs.
  
## Game Features

There is a pool of 82 items that can appear on the Bingo Card.

**Teams**  
Any number of players are supported. There are 4 team colours that can be chosen from. There is an option within the Lobby to randomise or clear teams. 

**Seeds**  
Bingo features "Seeds" where you can input a number code and it will create a Bingo Card from that. The same "Seed" number always yields the same Bingo Card and spawn locations. You can also share these codes with others so you can race using the same Card with the same team starting locations!

 **Custom World**  
Bingo is played in a custom world, with 4 changes to the default world generation:
- The overworld biomes have been customised and made smaller. Some biomes, like Birch Forest, have been removed entirely. This means that you do not need to travel for hours to find a jungle or a swamp; most biomes will be close by.
- Dungeon frequency is increased so that all players have a good chance of finding a dungeon whilst caving.
- Granite, diorite and andesite drops have been altered so that they drop cobblestone instead. This is to help with inventory management and to reduce clutter.
- Abandoned Mineshafts are turned off, so that finding a Mesa doesn't give a huge advantage based on terrain luck.

## Gameplay

**Teams**  
Each team will get a set separate spawning location dependent on the Bingo Card "Seed". At the start teams will get an overview of their spawn location before the game commences.

**The Bingo Card**  
Players are given a "Bingo Card" map picturing 25 different items. The goal is to race to collect these items as fast as possible to get 5-in-a-row Bingo.  

Each time you obtain an item on the card, a sound will play, your score will update and a text notification will appear in the chat.

You can see which Bingo items you have so far collected by "updating your map". To do so hold your maps and then drop one of them onto the ground.

## Game Options

All of the Settings can be changed within the Bingo Lobby which spawns in when you run the setup function.

**Game Modes**  
Bingo supports a variety of different game modes which alter the way the game is played:
 - Base Bingo - The most basic mode featured is "Bingo". To win get 5 items in a row, column or diagonal. This is the default/standard game mode.
 - Blackout - For extra challenge, you can play "Blackout", where you need to get all 25 items on the Bingo Card.
 - 25 Minutes - Gather as many items as possible within 25 minutes as a timed challenge.
- Lockout - Once 1 team gets a square no other team can get that square. First to Bingo or to get the high score wins the game (high score depends on how many teams are active).

**Game Configs**  
Bingo allows you to customise the gameplay with various pre-set configs:
- Night Vision - Players get the Night Vision effect.
- Speed - Players get the Speed II effect.
- Depth Strider - Players get boots with Depth Strider III enchant.
- Elytra - Players get an Elytra & Firework Rockets.
- All Recipes - Players get all recipes unlocked in the recipe book.
